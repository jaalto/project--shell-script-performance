CODE NOTES

    In case, you contribute more tests.

    Files:

    - Readable shebang with space "#! <interpreter>"
    - All test files start with prefix "t-" for short.
    - Files ending to *.bash are specific to Bash.
    - Files ending to *.sh can be run under POSIX
      compliant shells.

    Variables and Linting:

    - Variables are *not* "$quoted" for simplicity.
    - shellcheck(1) is deliberately not used
      because files are intended to be as straightforward
      as possible. Ref: <https://www.shellcheck.net>.

    Coding Style

    - Use readable --long options everywhere.

    - Allman for these:

	fn ()
	{
	    ...
	}

	for <test>
	do
	    ...
	done

	case "$var" in
	    glob) ...
		  ;;
	    glob) ...
		  ;;
	fi

    - K&R for placing 'then' in short conditionals:

	if <cmd>; then
	    ...
	fi

End of file
