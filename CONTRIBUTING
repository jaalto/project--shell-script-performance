CODE NOTES

    information for contributing more test cases.

    GENERAL <TEST CASE> FILE CONVENTIONS

    - Start with readable shebang with space "#! /bin/bash"

    - Name test files "t-<category>-*.sh", where
      category is one of:

	command	    - extermal commands
	dir	    - directory related
	file	    - file manipulation
	function    - function usage
	statement   - language structures
	string	    - string manipulation
	variable    - Anything about variables.
		      Use subtype prefix:
		      variable-var-*
		      variable-array-*
		      variable-hash-*

    GENERAL CODING STYLE CONSIDERATIONS

    Use relaxed conventions for
    maximum clarity and simplicity:

    - Use readable --long options everywhere.

    - Do not "$quote"; unless absolutely needed.

    - No need to lint using shellcheck(1) etc.
      The <test case> files are intended to be as
      straightforward as possible.
      Ref: <https://www.shellcheck.net>.

    - Allman style for these:

	fn()
	{
	    ...
	}

	for <test>
	do
	    ...
	done

	case "$var" in
	    glob) ...
		  ;;
	    glob) ...
		  ;;
	fi

    - K&R style for placing 'then':

	if <cmd>; then
	    ...
	fi
