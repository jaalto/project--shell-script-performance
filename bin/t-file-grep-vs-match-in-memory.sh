# Q: To search file for matches: in memory searh vs `grep`
# A: It is about 8-10x faster to read file into memory and then do matching
# priority: 10
#
#     t1a real 0m0.049s read once + bash regexp (read file once + use loop)
#     t1b real 0m0.054s read once + case..MATCH..esac (read file once + use loop)
#     t4  real 0m0.283s grep
#     t2  real 0m0.407s read + case..MATCH..esac (separate file calls)
#     t3  real 0m0.440s read + bash regexp (separate file calls)
#
# Code:
#
# See the test code for more information. Overview:
#
#     t1a read once and loop [[ str =~~ RE ]]
#     t1b read once and loop case..MATCH..end
#     t4  grep RE file in loop
#     t2  read every time in loop. case..MATCH..end
#     t3  read every time in loop. [[ str =~~ RE ]]
#
# Notes:
#
# Repeated reads of the same file
# probably utilizes Kernel cache to some
# extent. But it is still much faster to
# read file once into memory and then
# apply matching multiple times.
#
# The `grep` command is leaps ahead of
# re-reading the file in a loop and using
# the shellâ€™s own matching capabilities.
