# Q: What is the fastest way to read a file's size?
# A: Use `stat` or portable GNU `wc -c`.
# priority: 5
#
#     t1 real 0m0.288s stat -c file
#     t2 real 0m0.380s wc -c file; GNU version efectively is like stat
#     t3 real 0m0.461s ls -l + awk
#
# Notes:
#
# If you don't need portability, `stat` is the
# fastest. The caveat is that it is not defined in
# POSIX, and the options differ from one operating
# system to another.
